# Book Store
BStore is a Java project that simulates two different book stores.

## Features

- The project consists of two Java files: `SImple_bookStore.java`, `main_bookStore.java`.
- The `SImple_bookStore.java` file defines a class that represents a simple book store with attributes such as name, address, books, and revenue.
- The `main_bookStore.java` file creates two instances of the `SImple_bookStore` class and performs some operations on them, such as adding and selling books, printing the inventory and the revenue, and comparing the two stores.

## Installation

- To run the project, you need to have Java installed on your system.
- You can use any Java IDE or editor of your choice to open and edit the project files. Alternatively, you can use the command line to compile and run the project.
- To compile the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command: java main_bookStore

 ## Usage

 The project will output the results of the operations performed on the two book stores to the console. You can modify the project files to change the input data or the logic of the program.
